# NFS Mount Configuration Example
# Copy this to ~/.config/nfs-mount/config.yaml and customize for your setup

# List of NFS mounts
mounts:
  # Example mount entry - replace with your actual NFS server details
  - server: "192.168.1.100"        # IP or hostname of your NFS server
    share: "/mnt/tank/media"       # Share path on the NFS server
    nfs_version: "4"               # NFS version: "3" or "4"
    mount_name: "nas-media"        # Local name for the mount (no spaces)
    enabled: true                   # Set to false to disable this mount

  # Another example (commented out)
  # - server: "truenas.local"
  #   share: "/mnt/pool/backups"
  #   nfs_version: "4"
  #   mount_name: "nas-backups"
  #   enabled: true

  # NFSv3 example (for older servers)
  # - server: "192.168.1.101"
  #   share: "/export/files"
  #   nfs_version: "3"
  #   mount_name: "old-nas-files"
  #   enabled: true

# Notes:
# - server: IP address or hostname of your NFS server
# - share: The exported path on the NFS server
# - nfs_version: Use "4" for NFSv4 (recommended) or "3" for NFSv3
# - mount_name: Used to create the local mount point at ~/External/[mount_name]
#   * Only use letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
#   * No spaces or special characters
# - enabled: Set to false to temporarily disable a mount without deleting it
#
# All mounts will be created under ~/External/
# Example: ~/External/nas-media
